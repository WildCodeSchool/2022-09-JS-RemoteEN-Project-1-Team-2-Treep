Wild Code School Project 1 (Remote EN) Website: https://wildcodeschool.github.io/2022-09-JS-RemoteEN-Project-1-Team-2-Treep/

The Treep project is a concept project created on an original idea of Pauline Kraus. 
The team behind the conception is composed of: Pierre Basck, Osvaldo Felices, Anna Vachluk, Russell James Corpuz and Pauline Kraus.

Treep is a fictitious NGO whose lifelong goal is to fight the effect of wildfires due to climate change. 
If the project is still at a conceptual stage, once implemented, it would answer the preoccupations of a client.
